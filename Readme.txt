HW09: Galaga in GBA
Name: Neil Barooah

Hello! Get ready to play the Galaga! The earth is being invaded by huge insect-like aliens. Your job is to destroy them with your spaceship. Careful! These monsters charge on to your spaceship, so you must avoid them. Otherwise, you lose a life (You're given a total of 3 lives to accomplish this mission). You can do this by navigating your spaceship to the left, right, up or down. You've been provided with missiles that you can trigger using the button A (Z in computer). You score 100 points for each alien you destroy. There are 4 levels in this game. Finish them all to destroy the alien race.

The game over screen is displayed when you lose all 3 lives!
If you finish all four levels, you're either directed to level 1 if you press start, or to the title screen if you press select.

Enjoy!
